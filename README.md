#  Wi-Fi & Hotspot Password Finder  

##  About  
Wi-Fi & Hotspot Password Finder is a simple program that allows you to retrieve and view locally saved Wi-Fi passwords on your computer.
**Note:** 
This tool only works on Windows 10. I haven’t tested it on Windows 11 yet, but the commands are likely the same.
It only works for networks that are already saved on your device.

## Features  
 ‣ Retrieve saved Wi-Fi & hotspot passwords 
 ‣ Easy-to-use command-line interface 
 ‣ Automatically saves credentials to a text file 
 ‣ Fun Easter egg if the Wi-Fi isn't saved on your device
